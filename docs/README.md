# Overview of OctoAcme's Project Management Processes

OctoAcme employs a structured and iterative approach to project management, ensuring efficient delivery of high-quality products. The process lifecycle is divided into five key phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each phase is supported by clear deliverables and checklists to maintain alignment across teams.

## Key Workflows

- **Initiation**: Produces a one-pager outlining the problem, objectives, stakeholders, and risks.
- **Planning**: Focuses on creating a prioritized backlog, defining the Definition of Done (DoD), and identifying dependencies.
- **Execution**: Utilizes iterative delivery with GitHub Projects to track progress using columns such as Backlog, In Progress, and Done.
- **Release**: Includes pre-release checklists, deployment verification, and stakeholder announcements.
- **Retrospective**: Captures lessons learned and actionable feedback for continuous improvement.

## Roles and Personas

- **Project Manager**: Coordinates timelines, risks, and communication.
- **Product Manager**: Owns prioritization and defines success metrics.
- **Developers**: Implement features and ensure testability.
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and compliance with the Definition of Done.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input and approvals to align business goals.

## Communication Strategies

OctoAcme emphasizes transparency with:
- Daily standups and weekly delivery syncs.
- Sprint demos and stakeholder updates.
- Templates for incident reporting and risk communication.

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is embedded throughout the lifecycle:
- Automated CI pipelines for testing and security scans.
- Manual QA for critical features.
- Deployment checklists and rollback plans to minimize risks.

This comprehensive approach ensures OctoAcme delivers consistent, high-value outcomes while fostering collaboration and adaptability.
